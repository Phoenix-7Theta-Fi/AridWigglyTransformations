ChatGoogleGenerativeAI
This docs will help you get started with Google AI chat models. For detailed documentation

of all ChatGoogleGenerativeAI features and configurations head to the API reference.

Google AI offers a number of different chat models. For information on the latest models,

their features, context windows, etc. head to the Google AI docs.

GOOGLE AI VS GOOGLE CLOUD VERTEX AI

Google's Gemini models are accessible through Google AI and through Google Cloud

Vertex AI. Using Google AI just requires a Google account and an API key. Using Google

Cloud Vertex AI requires a Google Cloud account (with term agreements and billing) but

offers enterprise features like customer encription key, virtual private cloud, and more.

To learn more about the key features of the two APIs see the Google docs.

Setup

To access Google AI models you'll need to create a Google Acount account, get a Google AI

API key, and install the langchain-google-genai  integration package.

Credentials

Head to https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key to generate a Google AI API key. Once

you've done this set the GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable:

import getpass
import os

if "GOOGLE_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your Google AI API 
key: ")

If you want to get automated tracing of your model calls you can also set your LangSmith

API key by uncommenting below:

# os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your LangSmith API 
key: ")
# os.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"] = "true"

Installation

The LangChain Google AI integration lives in the langchain-google-genai  package:

https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/google_generative_ai/ 2/6

%pip install -qU langchain-google-genai

Instantiation

Now we can instantiate our model object and generate chat completions:

from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI

llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(
    model="gemini-1.5-pro",
    temperature=0,
    max_tokens=None,
    timeout=None,
    max_retries=2,
    # other params...
)

Chaining

We can chain our model with a prompt template like so:

from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        (
            "system",
            "You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to 
{output_language}.",
        ),
        ("human", "{input}"),
    ]
)

chain = prompt | llm
chain.invoke(
    {
        "input_language": "English",
        "output_language": "German",
        "input": "I love programming.",
    }
)

{'input_tokens': 16, 'output_tokens': 7, 'total_tokens': 23})

Safety Seings

Gemini models have default safety settings that can be overridden. If you are receiving lots

of "Safety Warnings" from your models, you can try tweaking the safety_settings  attribute

of the model. For example, to turn off safety blocking for dangerous content, you can

construct your LLM as follows:

from langchain_google_genai import (
    ChatGoogleGenerativeAI,
    HarmBlockThreshold,
    HarmCategory,
)

llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(
    model="gemini-1.5-pro",
    safety_settings={
        HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT: 
HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE,
    },
)

For an enumeration of the categories and thresholds available, see Google's safety setting

types.

    llm.invoke(
        "What are some of the pros and cons of Python as a programming 
language?"
    )
)

**Pros:**

* **Simplicity and Readability:** Python is known for its simple and easy-to-
read syntax, which makes it accessible to beginners and reduces the chance of 
errors. It uses indentation to define blocks of code, making the code 
structure clear and visually appealing.

* **Versatility:** Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be 
used for a wide range of tasks, including web development, data science, 
machine learning, and desktop applications. This versatility makes it a 
popular choice for various projects and industries.

* **Large Community:** Python has a vast and active community of developers, 
which contributes to its growth and popularity. This community provides 
extensive documentation, tutorials, and open-source libraries, making it easy 
for Python developers to find support and resources.

* **Extensive Libraries:** Python offers a rich collection of libraries and 
frameworks for various tasks, such as data analysis (NumPy, Pandas), web 
development (Django, Flask), machine learning (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow), and 
many more. These libraries provide pre-built functions and modules, allowing 
developers to quickly and efficiently solve common problems.

* **Cross-Platform Support:** Python is cross-platform, meaning it can run on 
various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This allows 
developers to write code that can be easily shared and used across different 
platforms.

**Cons:**

* **Speed and Performance:** Python is generally slower than compiled 
languages like C++ or Java due to its interpreted nature. This can be a 
disadvantage for performance-intensive tasks, such as real-time systems or 
heavy numerical computations.

* **Memory Usage:** Python programs tend to consume more memory compared to 
compiled languages. This is because Python uses a dynamic memory allocation 
system, which can lead to memory fragmentation and higher memory usage.

* **Lack of Static Typing:** Python is a dynamically typed language, which 
https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/google_ai/ 3/6



9/29/24, 6:22 PM Google AI | 🦜 🔗 LangChain

means that data types are not explicitly defined for variables. This can make 
it challenging to detect type errors during development, which can lead to 
unexpected behavior or errors at runtime.

* **GIL (Global Interpreter Lock):** Python uses a global interpreter lock 
(GIL) to ensure that only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time. 
This can limit the scalability and parallelism of Python programs, especially 
in multi-threaded or multiprocessing scenarios.

* **Package Management:** While Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries and 
packages, managing dependencies and package versions can be challenging. The 
Python Package Index (PyPI) is the official repository for Python packages, 
but it can be difficult to ensure compatibility and avoid conflicts between 
different versions of packages.

In winter's embrace, a silent ballet,
Snowflakes descend, a celestial display.
Whispering secrets, they softly fall,
A blanket of white, covering all.

With gentle grace, they paint the land,
Transforming the world into a winter wonderland.
Trees stand adorned in icy splendor,
A glistening spectacle, a sight to render.

Snowflakes twirl, like dancers on a stage,
Creating a symphony, a winter montage.
Their silent whispers, a sweet serenade,
As they dance and twirl, a snowy cascade.

In the hush of dawn, a frosty morn,
Snow sparkles bright, like diamonds reborn.
Each flake unique, in its own design,
A masterpiece crafted by the divine.

So let us revel in this wintry bliss,
As snowflakes fall, with a gentle kiss.
For in their embrace, we find a peace profound,
A frozen world, with magic all around.

Safety Seings

Gemini models have default safety settings that can be overridden. If you are receiving lots

of "Safety Warnings" from your models, you can try tweaking the safety_settings  attribute

Task type

GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings  optionally support a task_type , which currently must be

one of:

task_type_unspecified

retrieval_query

retrieval_document

semantic_similarity

By default, we use retrieval_document  in the embed_documents  method and

retrieval_query  in the embed_query  method. If you provide a task type, we will use that for

all methods.

%pip install --upgrade --quiet  matplotlib scikit-learn

)

All of these will be embedded with the 'retrieval_query' task set

query_vecs = [query_embeddings.embed_query(q) for q in [query, query_2, 
answer_1]]

All of these will be embedded with the 'retrieval_document' task set

doc_vecs = [doc_embeddings.embed_query(q) for q in [query, query_2,

Components Vector stores Qdrant

Qdrant

Qdrant (read: quadrant ) is a vector similarity search engine. It provides a production-

ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage vectors with additional

payload and extended filtering support. It makes it useful for all sorts of neural network

or semantic-based matching, faceted search, and other applications.

This documentation demonstrates how to use Qdrant with Langchain for dense/sparse and

hybrid retrieval.

This page documents the QdrantVectorStore  class that supports multiple retrieval

modes via Qdrant's new Query API. It requires you to run Qdrant v1.10.0 or above.

Setup

There are various modes of how to run Qdrant , and depending on the chosen one, there will

be some subtle differences. The options include:

Local mode, no server required

Docker deployments

Qdrant Cloud

See the installation instructions.

%pip install -qU langchain-qdrant

Credentials

There are no credentials needed to run the code in this notebook.

9/29/24, 6:25 PM Qdrant | 🦜 🔗 LangChain

If you want to get best in-class automated tracing of your model calls you can also set your

LangSmith API key by uncommenting below:

# os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your LangSmith API 
key: ")
# os.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"] = "true"

Initialization

Local mode

Python client allows you to run the same code in local mode without running the Qdrant

server. That's great for testing things out and debugging or storing just a small amount of

vectors. The embeddings might be fully kept in memory or persisted on disk.

In-memory

For some testing scenarios and quick experiments, you may prefer to keep all the data in

memory only, so it gets lost when the client is destroyed - usually at the end of your

script/notebook.

vector_store = QdrantVectorStore(
    client=client,
    collection_name="demo_collection",
    embedding=embeddings,
)

On-disk storage

Local mode, without using the Qdrant server, may also store your vectors on disk so they

persist between runs.

client = QdrantClient(path="/tmp/langchain_qdrant")

client.create_collection(
    collection_name="demo_collection",
    vectors_config=VectorParams(size=3072, distance=Distance.COSINE),
)

vector_store = QdrantVectorStore(
    client=client,
    collection_name="demo_collection",
    embedding=embeddings,
)

On-premise server deployment

No matter if you choose to launch Qdrant locally with a Docker container, or select a

Kubernetes deployment with the official Helm chart, the way you're going to connect to such

an instance will be identical. You'll need to provide a URL pointing to the service.

url = "<---qdrant url here --->"
docs = []  # put docs here
qdrant = QdrantVectorStore.from_documents(
    docs,

https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/qdrant/ 3/14

    prefer_grpc=True,
    collection_name="my_documents",
)

Qdrant Cloud

If you prefer not to keep yourself busy with managing the infrastructure, you can choose to

set up a fully-managed Qdrant cluster on Qdrant Cloud. There is a free forever 1GB cluster

included for trying out. The main difference with using a managed version of Qdrant is that

you'll need to provide an API key to secure your deployment from being accessed publicly.

The value can also be set in a QDRANT_API_KEY  environment variable.

url = "<---qdrant cloud cluster url here --->"
api_key = "<---api key here--->"
qdrant = QdrantVectorStore.from_documents(
    docs,
    embeddings,

    api_key=api_key,
    collection_name="my_documents",
)

Using an existing collection

To get an instance of langchain_qdrant.Qdrant  without loading any new documents or

texts, you can use the Qdrant.from_existing_collection()  method.

qdrant = QdrantVectorStore.from_existing_collection(
    embedding=embeddings,
    collection_name="my_documents",
    url="http://localhost:6333",

Query vector store

Once your vector store has been created and the relevant documents have been added you

will most likely wish to query it during the running of your chain or agent.

Query directly

The simplest scenario for using Qdrant vector store is to perform a similarity search. Under

the hood, our query will be encoded into vector embeddings and used to find similar

documents in Qdrant collection.

results = vector_store.similarity_search(
    "LangChain provides abstractions to make working with LLMs easy", k=2
)
for res in results:
    print(f"* {res.page_content} [{res.metadata}]")

QdrantVectorStore  supports 3 modes for similarity searches. They can be configured using

the retrieval_mode  parameter when setting up the class.

Dense Vector Search(Default)

Sparse Vector Search

Hybrid Search

Dense Vector Search

To search with only dense vectors,

The retrieval_mode  parameter should be set to RetrievalMode.DENSE (default).

A dense embeddings value should be provided to the embedding  parameter.

from langchain_qdrant import RetrievalMode

qdrant = QdrantVectorStore.from_documents(
    docs,
    embedding=embeddings,
    location=":memory:",
    collection_name="my_documents",
    retrieval_mode=RetrievalMode.DENSE,
)

query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
found_docs = qdrant.similarity_search(query)

Sparse Vector Search

To search with only sparse vectors,

The retrieval_mode  parameter should be set to RetrievalMode.SPARSE .

https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/qdrant/ 8/14



9/29/24, 6:25 PM Qdrant | 🦜 🔗 LangChain

An implementation of the SparseEmbeddings  interface using any sparse embeddings

provider has to be provided as value to the sparse_embedding  parameter.

The langchain-qdrant  package provides a FastEmbed based implementation out of the box.

To use it, install the FastEmbed package.

%pip install fastembed

from langchain_qdrant import FastEmbedSparse, RetrievalMode

sparse_embeddings = FastEmbedSparse(model_name="Qdrant/bm25")

qdrant = QdrantVectorStore.from_documents(
    docs,
    sparse_embedding=sparse_embeddings,
    location=":memory:",
    collection_name="my_documents",
    retrieval_mode=RetrievalMode.SPARSE,
)

query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
found_docs = qdrant.similarity_search(query)

Hybrid Vector Search

To perform a hybrid search using dense and sparse vectors with score fusion,

The retrieval_mode  parameter should be set to RetrievalMode.HYBRID .

A dense embeddings value should be provided to the embedding  parameter.

An implementation of the SparseEmbeddings  interface using any sparse embeddings

provider has to be provided as value to the sparse_embedding  parameter.

Note that if you've added documents with the HYBRID  mode, you can switch to any retrieval

mode when searching. Since both the dense and sparse vectors are available in the

collection.

https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/qdrant/ 9/14



9/29/24, 6:25 PM Qdrant | 🦜 🔗 LangChain

from langchain_qdrant import FastEmbedSparse, RetrievalMode

    collection_name="my_documents",
    retrieval_mode=RetrievalMode.HYBRID,
)

query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
found_docs = qdrant.similarity_search(query)

If you want to execute a similarity search and receive the corresponding scores you can run:

results = vector_store.similarity_search_with_score(
    query="Will it be hot tomorrow", k=1
)
for doc, score in results:
    print(f"* [SIM={score:3f}] {doc.page_content} [{doc.metadata}]")

For a full list of all the search functions available for a QdrantVectorStore , read the API

reference

Metadata filtering

Qdrant has an extensive filtering system with rich type support. It is also possible to use the

filters in Langchain, by passing an additional param to both the

similarity_search_with_score  and similarity_search  methods.

'_id': 'b0964ab5-5a14-47b4-a983-37fa5c5bd154', '_collection_name': 
'demo_collection'}]

Query by turning into retriever

You can also transform the vector store into a retriever for easier usage in your chains.

retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(search_type="mmr", search_kwargs={"k": 
1})
retriever.invoke("Stealing from the bank is a crime")

[Document(metadata={'source': 'news', '_id': '50d8d6ee-69bf-4173-a6a2-

Retrieval conceptual docs

Customizing Qdrant

There are options to use an existing Qdrant collection within your Langchain application. In

such cases, you may need to define how to map Qdrant point into the Langchain Document .

Named vectors

Qdrant supports multiple vectors per point by named vectors. If you work with a collection

created externally or want to have the differently named vector used, you can configure it by

providing its name.

from langchain_qdrant import RetrievalMode

QdrantVectorStore.from_documents(
    docs,
    embedding=embeddings,
    sparse_embedding=sparse_embeddings,
    location=":memory:",
    collection_name="my_documents_2",
    retrieval_mode=RetrievalMode.HYBRID,
    vector_name="custom_vector",
    sparse_vector_name="custom_sparse_vector",
)

Metadata

Qdrant stores your vector embeddings along with the optional JSON-like payload. Payloads

are optional, but since LangChain assumes the embeddings are generated from the

documents, we keep the context data, so you can extract the original texts as well.

By default, your document is going to be stored in the following payload structure:

https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/qdrant/ 12/14



9/29/24, 6:25 PM Qdrant | 🦜 🔗 LangChain

{
    "page_content": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet",
    "metadata": {
        "foo": "bar"
    }
}

You can, however, decide to use different keys for the page content and metadata. That's

useful if you already have a collection that you'd like to reuse.

QdrantVectorStore.from_documents(
    docs,
    embeddings,
    location=":memory:",
    collection_name="my_documents_2",
    content_payload_key="my_page_content_key",

Adaptive RAG

Adaptive RAG is a strategy for RAG that unites (1) query analysis with (2) active / self-
corrective RAG.

In the paper, they report query analysis to route across:

No Retrieval

Single-shot RAG

Iterative RAG

Let's build on this using LangGraph.

In our implementation, we will route between:

Web search: for questions related to recent events

Self-corrective RAG: for questions related to our index

Agentic RAG

Retrieval Agents are useful when we want to make decisions about whether to
retrieve from an index.

To implement a retrieval agent, we simply need to give an LLM access to a retriever
tool.

We can incorporate this into LangGraph.

Setup

First, let's download the required packages and set our API keys:

%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U --quiet langchain-community tiktoken langchain-
openai langchainhub chromadb langchain langgraph langchain-text-
splitters

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(key: str):
if key not in os.environ:

os.environ[key] = getpass.getpass(f"{key}:")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Set up LangSmith for LangGraph development

Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your
LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor
your LLM apps built with LangGraph   read more about how to get started here.

Retriever

First, we index 3 blog posts.

from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import
RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

urls = [
"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/",
"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-03-15-prompt-

engineering/",
"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-

llm/",
]

docs = [WebBaseLoader(url).load() for url in urls]
docs_list = [item for sublist in docs for item in sublist]

text_splitter =
RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder(

chunk_size=100, chunk_overlap=50
)
doc_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs_list)

# Add to vectorDB
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(

documents=doc_splits,
collection_name="rag-chroma",
embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings(),

)
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()

Then we create a retriever tool.

from langchain.tools.retriever import create_retriever_tool

retriever_tool = create_retriever_tool(
retriever,
"retrieve_blog_posts",
"Search and return information about Lilian Weng blog posts

on LLM agents, prompt engineering, and adversarial attacks on
LLMs.",
)

tools = [retriever_tool]

Agent State

We will de ne a graph.

A state  object that it passes around to each node.

Our state will be a list of messages .

Each node in our graph will append to it.

from typing import Annotated, Sequence
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage

from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

class AgentState(TypedDict):
# The add_messages function defines how an update should be

processed
# Default is to replace. add_messages says "append"
messages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], add_messages]

Nodes and Edges

We can lay out an agentic RAG graph like this:

The state is a set of messages

Each node will update (append to) state

Conditional edges decide which node to visit next

Basic Multi-agent Collaboration

A single agent can usually operate effectively using a handful of tools within a single
domain, but even using powerful models like gpt-4 , it can be less effective at using
many tools.

One way to approach complicated tasks is through a "divide-and-conquer" approach:
create an specialized agent for each task or domain and route tasks to the correct
"expert".

This notebook (inspired by the paper AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications
via Multi-Agent Conversation, by Wu, et. al.) shows one way to do this using
LangGraph.

The resulting graph will look something like the following diagram:

Before we get started, a quick note: this and other multi-agent notebooks are
designed to show how you can implement certain design patterns in LangGraph. If
the pattern suits your needs, we recommend combining it with some of the other
fundamental patterns described elsewhere in the docs for best performance.

You can skip ahead if you just want to see what the graph looks like.

De ne tools

We will also de ne some tools that our agents will use in the future

from typing import Annotated

TavilySearchResults

from langchain_experimental.utilities import PythonREPL

tavily_tool = TavilySearchResults(max_results=5)

result_str + "\n\nIf you have completed all tasks,

respond with FINAL ANSWER."
)

Create graph

Now that we've de ned our tools and made some helper functions, will create the
individual agents below and tell them how to talk to each other using LangGraph.

De ne State

We  rst de ne the state of the graph. This will just a list of messages, along with a
key to track the most recent sender

import operator
from typing import Annotated, Sequence
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# This defines the object that is passed between each node
# in the graph. We will create different nodes for each agent and
tool
class AgentState(TypedDict):

https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/multi_agent/multi-agent-collaboration/ 4/30



10/2/24, 7:59 AM Collaboration

messages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], operator.add]
sender: str

De ne Agent Nodes

We now need to de ne the nodes. First, let's de ne the nodes for the agents.

import functools

from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage

# Helper function to create a node for a given agent
def agent_node(state, agent, name):

result = agent.invoke(state)
# We convert the agent output into a format that is suitable

to append to the global state
if isinstance(result, ToolMessage):

pass
else:

result = AIMessage(**result.dict(exclude={"type",
"name"}), name=name)

return {
"messages": [result],
# Since we have a strict workflow, we can
# track the sender so we know who to pass to next.
"sender": name,

}

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")

# Research agent and node
research_agent = create_agent(

llm,
[tavily_tool],
system_message="You should provide accurate data for the

chart_generator to use.",
)
research_node = functools.partial(agent_node,
agent=research_agent, name="Researcher")

# chart_generator
chart_agent = create_agent(

llm,
[python_repl],
system_message="Any charts you display will be visible by

the user.",

https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/multi_agent/multi-agent-collaboration/ 5/30



10/2/24, 7:59 AM Collaboration

)
chart_node = functools.partial(agent_node, agent=chart_agent,
name="chart_generator")

De ne Tool Node

We now de ne a node to run the tools

from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode

tools = [tavily_tool, python_repl]
tool_node = ToolNode(tools)

De ne Edge Logic

We can de ne some of the edge logic that is needed to decide what to do based on
results of the agents

# Either agent can decide to end
from typing import Literal

def router(state):
# This is the router
messages = state["messages"]
last_message = messages[-1]
if last_message.tool_calls:

# The previous agent is invoking a tool
return "call_tool"

if "FINAL ANSWER" in last_message.content:
# Any agent decided the work is done
return END

return "continue"

De ne the Graph

We can now put it all together and de ne the graph!

workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)

workflow.add_node("Researcher", research_node)
workflow.add_node("chart_generator", chart_node)
workflow.add_node("call_tool", tool_node)

router,

workflow.add_conditional_edges(

router,

workflow.add_conditional_edges(

# Each agent node updates the 'sender' field
# the tool calling node does not, meaning
# this edge will route back to the original agent
# who invoked the tool
lambda x: x["sender"],
{

"Researcher": "Researcher",
"chart_generator": "chart_generator",

},
)
workflow.add_edge(START, "Researcher")
graph = workflow.compile()

from IPython.display import Image, display

try:

display(Image(graph.get_graph(xray=True).draw_mermaid_png()))
except Exception:

pass

is important to note that the typical absolute average revision be

on several tasks, we further utilized the launched
model, SelfRAG-LLaMA2-7b, as a new generator to
be consistent with their work and study the specific
improvement of our method.

Self-CRAG: To demonstrate that our plug-and-
play approach can be utilized in other concurrent
studies, we specifically designed to insert our
CRAG into the Self-RAG (Asai et al., 2023)
framework and named it Self-CRAG. Self-RAG
is an advanced RAG approach that introduces a
critic model to decide whether to retrieve and which
retrieved document to be referred for generation. It
meets our demand for deciding which action to be
triggered, thus we replaced the retrieved items in
Self-RAG with our processed internal knowledge
for Correct, external knowledge for Incorrect,
and combined knowledge for Ambiguous.

B.3 Results on PubHealth and Arc-Challenge
It is worth mentioning that the performance on
PubHealth based on LLaMA2-hf-7b was much
worse than others. We studied these cases and
found that LLaMA2-hf-7b is relatively weak in
instruction comprehension. Most of the cases
fail to generate True or False in such a binary-
question task, resulting in a low accuracy during
the evaluation. This situation somewhat happens in
Arc-Challenge as well, when the model is tasked
to generate the index of a candidate.



10/2/24, 7:52 AM Corrective RAG (CRAG)

Corrective RAG (CRAG)

Corrective-RAG (CRAG) is a strategy for RAG that incorporates self-re ection / self-
grading on retrieved documents.

In the paper here, a few steps are taken:

If at least one document exceeds the threshold for relevance, then it proceeds to
generation

Before generation, it performs knowledge re nement

This partitions the document into "knowledge strips"

It grades each strip, and  lters our irrelevant ones

If all documents fall below the relevance threshold or if the grader is unsure,
then the framework seeks an additional datasource

It will use web search to supplement retrieval

We will implement some of these ideas from scratch using LangGraph:

Let's skip the knowledge re nement phase as a  rst pass. This can be added
back as a node, if desired.

If any documents are irrelevant, let's opt to supplement retrieval with web search.

We'll use Tavily Search for web search.

Let's use query re-writing to optimize the query for web search.

Using Pydantic with LangChain

This notebook uses Pydantic v2 BaseModel , which requires langchain-core >= 0.3 .
Using langchain-core < 0.3  will result in errors due to mixing of Pydantic v1 and v2

The design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, plannin
g, and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditione
d on past experience. Memory stream is a long-term memory module t

Self-RAG

Self-RAG is a strategy for RAG that incorporates self-re ection / self-grading on
retrieved documents and generations.

In the paper, a few decisions are made:

   Should I retrieve from retriever, R  -

Input: x (question)  OR x (question) , y (generation)

Decides when to retrieve D  chunks with R

Output: yes, no, continue

   Are the retrieved passages D  relevant to the question x  -

Input: ( x (question) , d (chunk) ) for d  in D

d  provides useful information to solve x

Output: relevant, irrelevant

   Are the LLM generation from each chunk in D  is relevant to the chunk
(hallucinations, etc) -

Input: x (question) , d (chunk) , y (generation)  for d  in D

All of the veri cation-worthy statements in y (generation)  are supported by d

Output: {fully supported, partially supported, no support

   The LLM generation from each chunk in D  is a useful response to x (question)
-

Input: x (question) , y (generation)  for d  in D

y (generation)  is a useful response to x (question) .

Output: {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}

We will implement some of these ideas from scratch using LangGraph.

I think what you want is to add context (history). One possible solution is to turn this

yeah, thats what i got. I have set of tools (non-rag related), and another tool for

agents are not consistent on calling RAG tool more often, and rather respond to

SELF-RAG: LEARNING TO RETRIEVE, GENERATE, AND
CRITIQUE THROUGH SELF-REFLECTION

ABSTRACT

Despite their remarkable capabilities, large language models (LLMs) often produce
responses containing factual inaccuracies due to their sole reliance on the paramet-
ric knowledge they encapsulate. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an ad
hoc approach that augments LMs with retrieval of relevant knowledge, decreases
such issues. However, indiscriminately retrieving and incorporating a fixed number
of retrieved passages, regardless of whether retrieval is necessary, or passages are
relevant, diminishes LM versatility or can lead to unhelpful response generation.
We introduce a new framework called Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Gen-
eration (SELF-RAG) that enhances an LM’s quality and factuality through retrieval
and self-reflection. Our framework trains a single arbitrary LM that adaptively
retrieves passages on-demand, and generates and reflects on retrieved passages
and its own generations using special tokens, called reflection tokens. Generating
reflection tokens makes the LM controllable during the inference phase, enabling it
to tailor its behavior to diverse task requirements. Experiments show that SELF-
RAG (7B and 13B parameters) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs
and retrieval-augmented models on a diverse set of tasks. Specifically, SELF-RAG
outperforms ChatGPT and retrieval-augmented Llama2-chat on Open-domain QA,
reasoning and fact verification tasks, and it shows significant gains in improving
factuality and citation accuracy for long-form generations relative to these models.1

1 INTRODUCTION

State-of-the-art LLMs continue to struggle with factual errors (Mallen et al., 2023; Min et al., 2023)
despite their increased model and data scale (Ouyang et al., 2022). Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) methods (Figure 1 left; Lewis et al. 2020; Guu et al. 2020) augment the input of LLMs
with relevant retrieved passages, reducing factual errors in knowledge-intensive tasks (Ram et al.,
2023; Asai et al., 2023a). However, these methods may hinder the versatility of LLMs or introduce
unnecessary or off-topic passages that lead to low-quality generations (Shi et al., 2023) since they
retrieve passages indiscriminately regardless of whether the factual grounding is helpful. Moreover,
the output is not guaranteed to be consistent with retrieved relevant passages (Gao et al., 2023) since
the models are not explicitly trained to leverage and follow facts from provided passages. This
work introduces Self-Reflective Retrieval-augmented Generation (SELF-RAG) to improve an
LLM’s generation quality, including its factual accuracy without hurting its versatility, via on-demand
retrieval and self-reflection. We train an arbitrary LM in an end-to-end manner to learn to reflect on
its own generation process given a task input by generating both task output and intermittent special
tokens (i.e., reflection tokens). Reflection tokens are categorized into retrieval and critique tokens to
indicate the need for retrieval and its generation quality respectively (Figure 1 right). In particular,
given an input prompt and preceding generations, SELF-RAG first determines if augmenting the
continued generation with retrieved passages would be helpful. If so, it outputs a retrieval token that
calls a retriever model on demand (Step 1). Subsequently, SELF-RAG concurrently processes multiple
retrieved passages, evaluating their relevance and then generating corresponding task outputs (Step
2). It then generates critique tokens to criticize its own output and choose best one (Step 3) in terms
of factuality and overall quality. This process differs from conventional RAG (Figure 1 left), which

consistently retrieves a fixed number of documents for generation regardless of the retrieval necessity
(e.g., the bottom figure example does not require factual knowledge) and never second visits the
generation quality. Moreover, SELF-RAG provides citations for each segment with its self-assessment
of whether the output is supported by the passage, leading to easier fact verification.
SELF-RAG trains an arbitrary LM to generate text with reflection tokens by unifying them as the
next token prediction from the expanded model vocabulary. We train our generator LM on a diverse
collection of text interleaved with reflection tokens and retrieved passages. Reflection tokens, inspired
by reward models used in reinforcement learning (Ziegler et al., 2019; Ouyang et al., 2022), are
inserted offline into the original corpus by a trained critic model. This eliminates the need to host a
critic model during training, reducing overhead. The critic model, in part, is supervised on a dataset
of input, output, and corresponding reflection tokens collected by prompting a propriety LM (i.e.,
GPT-4; OpenAI 2023). While we draw inspiration from studies that use control tokens to start and
guide text generation (Lu et al., 2022; Keskar et al., 2019), our trained LM uses critique tokens to
assess its own predictions after each generated segment as an integral part of the generation output.
SELF-RAG further enables a customizable decoding algorithm to satisfy hard or soft constraints,
which are defined by reflection token predictions. In particular, our inference-time algorithm enables
us to (1) flexibly adjust retrieval frequency for different downstream applications and (2) customize
models’ behaviors to user preferences by leveraging reflection tokens through segment-level beam
search using the weighted linear sum of the reflection token probabilities as segment score.
Empirical results on six tasks, including reasoning and long-form generation, demonstrate that SELF-
RAG significantly outperforms pre-trained and instruction-tuned LLMs that have more parameters and
widely adopted RAG approaches with higher citation accuracy. In particular, SELF-RAG outperforms
retrieval-augmented ChatGPT on four tasks, Llama2-chat (Touvron et al., 2023) and Alpaca (Dubois
et al., 2023) on all tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of training and inference with
reflection tokens for overall performance improvements as well as test-time model customizations
(e.g., balancing the trade-off between citation previsions and completeness).

2 RELATED WORK

Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) augments the input
space of LMs with retrieved text passages (Guu et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020), leading to large
improvements in knowledge-intensive tasks after fine-tuning or used with off-the-shelf LMs (Ram
et al., 2023). A more recent work (Luo et al., 2023) instruction-tunes an LM with a fixed number

of retrieved passages prepended to input, or pre-train a retriever and LM jointly, followed by few-
shot fine-tuning on task datasets (Izacard et al., 2022b). While prior work often retrieves only
once at the beginning, Jiang et al. (2023) propose to adaptively retrieve passages for generation
on top of a proprietary LLM or Schick et al. (2023) train an LM to generate API calls for named
entities. Yet, the improved task performance of such approaches often comes at the expense of
runtime efficiency (Mallen et al., 2023), robustness to irrelevant context (Shi et al., 2023), and lack of
attributions (Liu et al., 2023a; Gao et al., 2023). We introduce a method to train an arbitrary LM to
learn to use retrieval on-demand for diverse instruction-following queries and introduce controlled
generation guided by reflections tokens to further improve generation quality and attributions.
Concurrent RAG work. A few concurrent works2 on RAG propose new training or prompting
strategies to improve widely-adopted RAG approaches. Lin et al. (2023) fine-tune both the retriever
and LM on instruction-tuning datasets in two steps. While we also train our model on diverse
instruction-following datasets, SELF-RAG enables retrieval on demand and selection of the best
possible model output via fine-grained self-reflection, making it widely applicable and more robust
and controllable. Yoran et al. (2023) use a natural language inference model and Xu et al. (2023) use
a summarization model to filter out or compress retrieved passages before using them to prompt the
LM to generate the output. SELF-RAG processes passages in parallel and filters out irrelevant ones
through self-reflection, without relying on external models at inference. Moreover, our self-reflection
mechanism also evaluates other aspects of the model output quality including factuality. LATS (Zhou
et al., 2023) prompt off-the-shelf LMs to search for relevant information for question answering tasks
and to generate with tree search, guided by LM-generated value scores. While their value function
simply indicates an overall score of each generation, SELF-RAG trains to an arbitrary LM to learn to
generate fine-grained self-reflection and customizable inference.
Training and generating with critics. Training LLMs with reinforcement learning (e.g., Proximal
Policy Optimization or PPO; Schulman et al. 2017) from human feedback (RLHF) has proven
effective in aligning LLMs with human preferences (Ouyang et al., 2022). Wu et al. (2023) introduce
fine-grained RLHF with multiple reward models. Though our work also studies fine-grained critique
on retrieval and generation, we train our target LM on task examples augmented with reflection
tokens from a critic model offline, with a far lower training cost compared to RLHF. In addition,
reflection tokens in SELF-RAG enable controllable generation at inference, while RLHF focuses on
human preference alignment during training. Other works use general control tokens to guide LM
generation (Lu et al., 2022; Korbak et al., 2023), while SELF-RAG uses reflection tokens to decide the
need for retrieval and to self-evaluate generation quality. Xie et al. (2023) propose a self-evaluation-
guided decoding framework, but they focus only on reasoning tasks with one evaluation dimension
(reasoning path consistency) and without retrieval. Recent work on LLM refinement (Dhuliawala
et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Paul et al., 2023) prompts a model to generate task output, natural
language feedback and refined task output iteratively, but at the cost of inference efficiency.

3 SELF-RAG: LEARNING TO RETRIEVE, GENERATE AND CRITIQUE

We introduce Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SELF-RAG), shown in Figure 1.
SELF-RAG is a framework that enhances the quality and factuality of an LLM through retrieval and
self-reflection, without sacrificing LLM’s original creativity and versatility. Our end-to-end training
lets an LM M generate text informed by retrieved passages, if needed, and criticize the output by
learning to generate special tokens. These reflection tokens (Table 1) signal the need for retrieval
or confirm the output’s relevance, support, or completeness. In contrast, common RAG approaches
retrieve passages indiscriminately, without ensuring complete support from cited sources.

3.1 PROBLEM FORMALIZATION AND OVERVIEW

Formally, given input x, we train M to sequentially generate textual outputs y consisting of multiple
segments y = [y1, . . . , yT ], where yt indicates a sequence of tokens for the t-th segment.3 Generated
tokens in yt include text from the original vocabulary as well as the reflection tokens (Table 1).

2All work is arXived within a week of this preprint.
3In this paper, we treat one sentence as a segment in our experiments, but our framework is applicable to any

segment unit (i.e., sub-sentence).

Inference overview. Figure 1 and Algorithm 1 present an overview of SELF-RAG at inference. For
every x and preceding generation y<t, the model decodes a retrieval token to evaluate the utility
of retrieval. If retrieval is not required, the model predicts the next output segment, as it does in a
standard LM. If retrieval is needed, the model generates: a critique token to evaluate the retrieved
passage’s relevance, the next response segment, and a critique token to evaluate if the information in
the response segment is supported by the passage. Finally, a new critique token evaluates the overall
utility of the response.4 To generate each segment, SELF-RAG processes multiple passages in parallel
and uses its own generated reflection tokens to enforce soft constraints (Section 3.3) or hard control
(Algorithm 1) over the generated task output. For instance, in Figure 1 (right), the retrieved passages
d1 is selected at the first time step since d2 does not provide direct evidence ( ISREL is Irrelevant)
and d3 output is only partially supported while d1 are fully supported.
Training overview. SELF-RAG enables an arbitrary LM to generate text with reflection tokens
by unifying them as next token predictions from the expanded model vocabulary (i.e., the original
vocabulary plus reflection tokens). Specifically, we train the generator model M on a curated corpus
with interleaving passages retrieved by a retriever R and reflection tokens predicted by a critic model
C (summarized in Appendix Algorithm 2). We train C to generate reflection tokens for evaluating
retrieved passages and the quality of a given task output (Section 3.2.1). Using the critic model, we
update the training corpus by inserting reflection tokens into task outputs offline. Subsequently, we
train the final generator model (M) using the conventional LM objective (Section 3.2.2) to enable
M to generate reflection tokens by itself without relying on the critic at inference time.

3.2 SELF-RAG TRAINING

Here, we describe the supervised data collection and training of two models, the critic C (Section 3.2.1)
and the generator M (Section 3.2.2).

3.2.1 TRAINING THE CRITIC MODEL

Data collection for critic model. Manual annotation of reflection tokens for each segment is
expensive (Wu et al., 2023). A state-of-the-art LLM like GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) can be effectively

4We follow Liu et al. (2023a) in using a “perceived” utility value that is independent of retrieved passages.

used to generate such feedback (Liu et al., 2023b). However, depending on such proprietary LMs
can raise API costs and diminish reproducibility (Chen et al., 2023). We create supervised data by
prompting GPT-4 to generate reflection tokens and then distill their knowledge into an in-house C.
For each group of reflection tokens, we randomly sample instances from the original training data:
{Xsample, Y sample} ∼ {X,Y }. As different reflection token groups have their own definitions and
input, as shown in Table 1, we use different instruction prompts for them. Here, we use Retrieve as
an example. We prompt GPT-4 with a type-specific instruction (“Given an instruction, make a
judgment on whether finding some external documents from the web helps to generate a better
response.”) followed by few-shot demonstrations I the original task input x and output y to predict
an appropriate reflection token as text: p(r|I, x, y). Manual assessment reveals that GPT-4 reflection
token predictions show high agreement with human evaluations. We collect 4k-20k supervised
training data for each type and combine them to form training data for C. Appendix Section D shows
the full list of instructions, and A.1 contains more details and our analysis.

Critic learning. After we collect training data Dcritic, we initialize C with a pre-trained LM and
train it on Dcritic using a standard conditional language modeling objective, maximizing likelihood:

maxE p (r|x, y), r for reflection tokens. (1)
C ((x,y),r)∼D log

critic C

Though the initial model can be any pre-trained LM, we use the same one as the generator LM
(i.e., Llama 2-7B; Touvron et al. 2023) for C initialization. The critic achieves a higher than 90%
agreement with GPT-4-based predictions on most reflection token categories (Appendix Table 5).

3.2.2 TRAINING THE GENERATOR MODEL

Data collection for generator. Given an input-output pair (x, y), we augment the original output
y using the retrieval and critic models to create supervised data that precisely mimics the SELF-
RAG inference-time process (Section 3.1). For each segment yt ∈ y, we run C to assess whether
additional passages could help to enhance generation. If retrieval is required, the retrieval special
token Retrieve =Yes is added, and R retrieves the top K passages, D. For each passage, C further
evaluates whether the passage is relevant and predicts ISREL . If a passage is relevant, C further
evaluates whether the passage supports the model generation and predicts ISSUP . Critique tokens

ISREL and ISSUP are appended after the retrieved passage or generations. At the end of the output, y
(or yT ), C predicts the overall utility token ISUSE , and an augmented output with reflection tokens
and the original input pair is added to Dgen. See the example training data in Figure 2.
Generator learning. We train the generator model M by training on the curated corpus augmented
with reflection tokens Dgen using the standard next token objective:

maxE
M (x,y,r)∼D log p y, r|x). (2)

gen M(

Unlike C training (Eq. 1), M learns to predict the target output as well as the reflection tokens. During
training, we mask out the retrieved text chunks (surrounded by <p> and </p> in Figure 2) for loss
calculation and expand the original vocabulary V with a set of reflection tokens { Critique , Retrieve }.

Connections to prior work on learning with critique. Recent work incorporates additional
critique (feedback) during training, e.g., RLHF (Ouyang et al. 2022) via PPO. While PPO relies on

Preprint.

separate reward models during training, we compute critique offline and directly insert them into the
training corpus, where the generator LM is trained with a standard LM objective. This significantly
reduces training costs compared to PPO. Our work also relates to prior work that incorporates special
tokens to control generation (Keskar et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2022; Korbak et al., 2023). Our SELF-RAG
learns to generate special tokens to evaluate its own prediction after each generated segment, enabling
the use of a soft re-ranking mechanism or hard constraints at inference (discussed next).

3.3 SELF-RAG INFERENCE

Generating reflection tokens to self-evaluate its own output makes SELF-RAG controllable during the
inference phase, enabling it to tailor its behavior to diverse task requirements. For tasks demanding
factual accuracy (Min et al., 2023), we aim for the model to retrieve passages more frequently to
ensure that the output aligns closely with the available evidence. Conversely, in more open-ended
tasks, like composing a personal experience essay, the emphasis shifts towards retrieving less and
prioritizing the overall creativity or utility score. In this section, we describe approaches to enforce
control to meet these distinct objectives during the inference process.
Adaptive retrieval with threshold. SELF-RAG dynamically decides when to retrieve text passages by
predicting Retrieve . Alternatively, our framework allows a threshold to be set. Specifically, if the prob-
ability of generating the Retrieve =Yes token normalized over all output tokens in Retrieve surpasses a
designated threshold, we trigger retrieval (details in Appendix Section A.3).
Tree-decoding with critique tokens. At each segment step t, when retrieval is required, based either
on hard or soft conditions, R retrieves K passages, and the generator M processes each passage in
parallel and outputs K different continuation candidates. We conduct a segment-level beam search
(with the beam size=B) to obtain the top-B segment continuations at each timestamp t, and return
the best sequence at the end of generation. The score of each segment yt with respect to passage d is
updated with a critic score S that is the linear weighted sum of the normalized probability of each
Critique token type. For each critique token group G (e.g., ISREL ), we denote its score at timestamp
t as sGt , and we compute a segment score as follows:

f(yt, d, Critique∑) = p(yt|x, d, y<t)) + S( Critique ),where (3)

S( Critique ) = wGsGt for G = { ISREL , ISSUP , ISUSE }, (4)
G∈G

where sGt = ∑ pt(r̂) stands for the generation pr
NG obability of the most desirable reflection token
i=1 pt(ri)

r̂ (e.g., ISREL =Relevant) for the critique token type G with NG distinct tokens (that represent
different possible values for G). The weights wG in Eq. 4 are hyperparameters that can be adjusted
at inference time to enable customized behaviors at test time. For instance, to ensure that result
y is mostly supported by evidence, we can set a weight term for the ISSUP score higher, while
relatively lowering weights for other aspects. Alternatively, we could further enforce hard constraints
during decoding using Critique . Instead of using a soft reward function in Eq. 4, we could explicitly
filter out a segment continuation when the model generates an undesirable Critique token (e.g.,

ISSUP =No support) . Balancing the trade-off between multiple preferences has been studied
in RLHF (Touvron et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023), which often requires training to change models’
behaviors. SELF-RAG tailors an LM with no additional training.

4 EXPERIMENTS

4.1 TASKS AND DATASETS

We conduct evaluations of our SELF-RAG and diverse baselines on a range of downstream tasks,
holistically evaluating outputs with metrics designed to assess overall correctness, factuality, and
fluency. Throughout these experiments, we conduct zero-shot evaluations, where we provide instruc-
tions describing tasks without few-shot demonstrations (Wei et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022). Details of
our experiments’ settings, including test-time instructions, are available in the Appendix Section B.1.
Closed-set tasks include two datasets, i.e., a fact verification dataset about public health (PubHealth;
Zhang et al. 2023) and a multiple-choice reasoning dataset created from scientific exams (ARC-

Challenge; Clark et al. 2018). We use accuracy as an evaluation metric and report on the test set. We
aggregate the answer probabilities of target classes for both of these datasets (Appendix Section B.2).
Short-form generations tasks include two open-domain question answering (QA) datasets,
PopQA (Mallen et al., 2023) and TriviaQA-unfiltered (Joshi et al., 2017), where systems need
to answer arbitrary questions about factual knowledge. For PopQA, we use the long-tail subset,
consisting of 1,399 rare entity queries whose monthly Wikipedia page views are less than 100. As the
TriviaQA-unfiltered (open) test set is not publicly available, we follow prior work’s validation and
test split (Min et al., 2019; Guu et al., 2020), using 11,313 test queries for evaluation. We evaluate
performance based on whether gold answers are included in the model generations instead of strictly
requiring exact matching, following Mallen et al. (2023); Schick et al. (2023).
Long-form generation tasks include a biography generation task (Min et al., 2023) and a long-form
QA task ALCE-ASQA Gao et al. (2023); Stelmakh et al. (2022). We use FactScore (Min et al.,
2023) to evaluate biographies, and we use official metrics of correctness (str-em), fluency based on
MAUVE (Pillutla et al., 2021), and citation precision and recall (Gao et al., 2023) for ASQA. 5

4.2 BASELINES

Baselines without retrievals. We evaluate strong publicly available pre-trained LLMs,
Llama27B,13B (Touvron et al., 2023), instruction-tuned models, Alpaca7B,13B (Dubois et al., 2023)
(our replication based on Llama2); and models trained and reinforced using private data, Chat-
GPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) and Llama2-chat13B. For instruction-tuned LMs, we use the official
system prompt or instruction format used during training if publicly available. We also compare our
method to concurrent work, CoVE65B (Dhuliawala et al., 2023), which introduces iterative prompt
engineering to improve the factuality of LLM generations.
Baselines with retrievals. We evaluate models augmented with retrieval at test time or during training.
The first category includes standard RAG baselines, where an LM (Llama2, Alpaca) generates output
given the query prepended with the top retrieved documents using the same retriever as in our system.
It also includes Llama2-FT, where Llama2 is fine-tuned on all training data we use without the
reflection tokens or retrieved passages. We also report the result of retrieval-augmented baselines
with LMs trained with private data: Ret-ChatGPT and Ret-Llama2-chat, which deploy the same
augmentation technique above, as well as perplexity.ai, an InstructGPT-based production search
system. The second category includes concurrent methods that are trained with retrieved text
passages, i.e., SAIL (Luo et al., 2023) to instruction-tune an LM on the Alpaca instruction-tuning
data with top retrieved documents inserted before instructions, and Toolformer (Schick et al., 2023)
to pre-train an LM with API calls (e.g., Wikipedia APIs).6

4.3 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS

Training data and settings. Our training data consists of diverse instruction-following input-output
pairs. In particular, we sample instances from Open-Instruct processed data (Wang et al., 2023) and
knowledge-intensive datasets (Petroni et al., 2021; Stelmakh et al., 2022; Mihaylov et al., 2018). In
total, we use 150k instruction-output pairs. We use Llama2 7B and 13B (Touvron et al., 2023) as
our generator base LM, and we use Llama2 7B as our base critic LM. For the retriever model R, we
use off-the-shelf Contriever-MS MARCO (Izacard et al., 2022a) by default and retrieve up to ten
documents for each input. More training details are in the Appendix Section B.1.
Inference settings. As a default configuration, we assign the weight terms ISREL , ISSUP , ISUSE

values of 1.0, 1.0 and 0.5, respectively. To encourage frequent retrieval, we set the retrieval threshold
to 0.2 for most tasks and to 0 for ALCE (Gao et al., 2023) due to citation requirements. We speed
up inference using vllm (Kwon et al., 2023). At each segment level, we adopt a beam width of 2.
For a token-level generation, we use greedy decoding. By default, we use the top five documents
from Contriever-MS MARCO (Izacard et al., 2022a); for biographies and open-domain QA, we
use additional top five documents retrieved by a web search engine, following Luo et al. (2023);
for ASQA, we use the author-provided top 5 documents by GTR-XXL (Ni et al., 2022) across all
baselines for a fair comparison.

5 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

5.1 MAIN RESULTS

Comparison against baselines without retrieval. Table 2 (top) presents the baselines without
retrieval. Our SELF-RAG (bottom two rows) demonstrates a substantial performance advantage
over supervised fine-tuned LLMs in all tasks and even outperforms ChatGPT in PubHealth, PopQA,
biography generations, and ASQA (Rouge and MAUVE). Our approach also significantly outperforms
a concurrent method that employs sophisticated prompt engineering; specifically, on the bio generation
task, our 7B and 13B models outperform the concurrent CoVE (Dhuliawala et al., 2023), which
iteratively prompts Llama265B to refine output.
Comparison against baselines with retrieval. As shown in Tables 2 (bottom), our SELF-RAG also
outperforms existing RAG in many tasks, obtaining the best performance among non-proprietary
LM-based models on all tasks. While our method outperforms other baselines, on PopQA or Bio,
powerful instruction-tuned LMs with retrieval (e.g., LLama2-chat, Alpaca) show large gains from
their non-retrieval baselines. However, we found that these baselines provide limited solutions for
tasks where we cannot simply copy or extract sub-strings of retrieved passages. On PubHealth
and ARC-Challenge, baselines with retrieval do not improve performance notably from their no-
retrieval counterparts. We also observe that most baselines with retrieval struggle to improve citation
accuracy. On ASQA, our model shows significantly higher citation precision and recall than all
models except ChatGPT. Gao et al. (2023) found that ChatGPT consistently exhibits superior efficacy
in this particular task, surpassing smaller LMs. Our SELF-RAG bridges this performance gap, even
outperforming ChatGPT in citation precision, which measures whether the model-generated claim is
fully supported by cited evidence. We also found that on the metrics for factual precision, SELF-RAG
7B occasionally outperforms our 13B due to the tendency of smaller SELF-RAG to often generate

precisely grounded yet shorter outputs. Llama2-FT7B, which is the baseline LM trained on the same
instruction-output pairs as SELF-RAG without retrieval or self-reflection and is retrieval-augmented
at test time only, lags behind SELF-RAG. This result indicates SELF-RAG gains are not solely from
training data and demonstrate the effectiveness of SELF-RAG framework.

5.2 ANALYSIS

Ablation studies. We conduct a set of ablations of our framework to identify which factors play
key roles. We evaluate two model variants trained differently than our model: No Retriever trains an
LM using the standard instruction-following method given instruction-output pairs, without retrieved
passages; No Critic trains an LM trained with input-output pairs that are always augmented with the
top one retrieved document without reflection tokens. This is similar to SAIL (Luo et al., 2023), and
we use our instruction-output data instead of using the Alpaca dataset (Dubois et al., 2023), as in
SAIL. We also conduct ablation on our inference-time algorithm, including No retrieval disables
retrieval during inference; Hard constraints indicates the model performance that retrieves when
Retrieve =Yes instead of using the adaptive threshold; Retrieve top 1 always retrieves and uses the
top one document only, similar to standard RAG approaches; Remove ISSUP indicates the model
performance that removes ISSUP score only during critique-guided beam search in Eq. 4. In this
ablation experiment, we use a training instance size of 50k for a more efficient exploration of training
variations. Later in this section, we conduct an analysis of the effect of training data size. We conduct
the ablation studies on three datasets, PopQA, PubHealth, and ASQA. On ASQA, we evaluate models
on sampled 150 instances and exclude ablations involving adaptive or no retrieval processes.
We show in Table 3a the ablation results. The top part of the table shows results for training ablations,
and the bottom part is for inference ablations. We see that all components play important roles. We
also observe a large performance gap between SELF-RAG and No Retriever or Critic baselines across
tasks, indicating that training an LM with those models largely contributes to the performance gain of
SELF-RAG. Using the top passages regardless of their relevance (Retrieve top 1) as in conventional
RAG approaches causes a large drop in PopQA and ASQA, and removing ISSUP during the beam
search results hurts performance on ASQA. This demonstrates the effectiveness of SELF-RAG’s
capabilities of carefully selecting generations based fine-grained multiple criterion, instead of naively
using all of the top passages from the retrieval model or solely depending on relevance scores.
Effects of inference-time customization. One key benefit of our proposed framework is that it
enables us to control how much each critique type affects the final generation sampling. We analyze
the effects of different parameter weights on the top of our 7B model during inference time on
ASQA, where multiple evaluation aspects are considered. Figure 3b shows the effects of changing
the weighting term for ISSUP , which criticizes how supported the output is by the text passage. As
the figure shows, increasing the weight leads to positive effects on the models’ citation precision
since this puts more emphasis on whether model generation is supported by the evidence. On the

contrary, a larger weight results in lower MAUVE scores: when generation gets longer and more
fluent, there are often more claims that are not fully supported by citations, consistent with findings
by Liu et al. (2023a). Our framework lets practitioners choose and customize models’ behaviors at
test time by adjusting such parameters without requiring additional training.
Efficiency and accuracy trade-off. Using our framework, practitioners can adjust how often retrieval
occurs using the token probability of reward tokens. We evaluate how this adaptive threshold affects
overall accuracy and frequency of retrieval, and we evaluate the performance with varying numbers
of threshold δ (larger δ results in less retrieval) on PubHealth and PopQA. Figure 3c shows that
the model’s retrieval frequencies dramatically change on both datasets. as δ varies. On one hand,
performance deterioration by retrieving less is smaller on PubHealth but larger in PopQA.
Effects of training data size. We conduct an analysis of how the data scale affects the model’s
performance. In particular, we randomly sample 5k, 10k, 20k, and 50k instances from our original
150k training instances, and fine-tune four SELF-RAG 7B variants on those subsets. Then, we compare
the model performance on PopQA, PubHealth, and ASQA (citation precision) with our final SELF-
RAG trained on the full 150k instances. We also evaluate Figures 4a, 4b and 4c shows the models’
performance trained on different amount of data. Across all datasets, increasing data size often shows
upward trajectories and the improvements are significantly larger in PopQA and ASQA, while we do
not observed such significant improvements on Llama2-FT7B when increasing the training data from
50k to 150k. These results also indicate that further expanding the training data of SELF-RAG may
lead to further improvements, although in this work we limit our training data size to 150k.
Human evaluations. We conduct small human evaluations on SELF-RAG outputs, as well as the
reliability of predicted reflection tokens. In particular, we sampled 50 samples from PopQA and Bio
results. Following Menick et al. (2022), human annotators evaluate S&P, which indicates whether
the model output is plausible (i.e., the output is a reasonable and on-topic response to the question
as if it were occurring in a conversation) and supported (i.e., the provided evidence is sufficient to
verify the validity of the answer). For S&P, we do not consider the instances where SELF-RAG
predicts irrelevant or no support. We then ask our annotators whether the model-predicted
reflection tokens about ISREL and ISSUP match their inspections (e.g., whether the fully supported
output is supported by the cited evidence). Human annotators find SELF-RAG answers are often
plausible and supported by relevant passages with higher S&P scores on short-form PopQA, which is
consistent with Menick et al. (2022). Human annotators also find ISREL and ISSUP reflection token
predictions are mostly aligned with their assessments. Appendix Table 6 shows several annotated
examples and explanations on assessments.

6 CONCLUSION

This work introduces SELF-RAG, a new framework to enhance the quality and factuality of LLMs
through retrieval on demand and self-reflection. SELF-RAG trains an LM to learn to retrieve, generate,
and critique text passages and its own generation by predicting the next tokens from its original
vocabulary as well as newly added special tokens, called reflection tokens. SELF-RAG further enables
the tailoring of LM behaviors at test time by leveraging reflection tokens. Our holistic evaluations on
six tasks using multiple metrics demonstrate that SELF-RAG significantly outperforms LLMs with
more parameters or with conventional retrieval-augmented generation approaches.

ETHICAL CONCERNS

This work aims to improve the factuality of LLM outputs, the lack of which continues to cause nu-
merous real-world problems (e.g., spread of misinformation and provision of incorrect and dangerous
advice). While our method shows significant improvements in terms of performance, factuality, and
citation accuracy, it can still generate outputs that are not fully supported by the citations. We hope
that explicit self-reflection and fine-grained attribution may help users verify factual errors in the
model outputs.

A SELF-RAG DETAILS

A.1 REFLECTION TOKENS.

Definitions of reflection tokens. Below, we provide a detailed definition of reflection type and
output tokens. The first three aspects will be provided at each segment level, while the final aspect is
only given at each output level.

• Retrieval-on-demand ( Retrieve ): Given an input and previous-step generation (if applicable),
an LM determines whether the continuation requires factual grounding. No indicates retrieval
is unnecessary as the sequence does not require factual grounding or may not be enhanced by
knowledge retrieval, Yes indicates retrieval is necessary. We additionally have continue
to use evidence, which indicates that a model can continue to use the evidence retrieved
previously. For instance, a passage may contain rich factual information, and thus SELF-RAG
generates multiple segments based on the passage.

• Relevant ( ISREL ): Retrieved knowledge may not be always relevant to the input. This aspect
indicates whether the evidence provides useful information (Relevant) or not (Irrelevant).

• Supported ( ISSUP ): Attribution is the concept of whether the output is fully supported by
certain evidence (Menick et al., 2022; Bohnet et al., 2022). This aspect judges how much infor-
mation in the output is entailed by the evidence. We evaluate attributions in three scale, Fully
supported, Partially supported, and No support / Contradictory, follow-
ing Yue et al. (2023); Nakano et al. (2021).

• Useful ( ISUSE ): Following the definitions from Liu et al. (2023a), we define the perceived utility
as whether the response is a helpful and informative answer to the query, independently from
whether it is in fact factual or not. This can be also viewed as plausibility in Menick et al. (2022).
For usefulness, we use a five-scale evaluation (1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest).

Details of GPT-4-based data collections. We use the instruction and demonstration pairs to prompt
GPT-4, listed in Section D. Following an official recommendation, we separate instructions and
outputs with “##”. We use the temperature 1 and set the maximum output token counts to be 200. We
discard instances where GPT-4 does not follow the designated output formats or output sequences
that do not match our expected category names. As a result, we collected 1,2594 for Retrieve , 11,181
for ISSUP , 19,317 for relevance, 3,831 for utility.

Manual analysis of the GPT-4 predictions. The authors of this paper manually assess randomly
sampled 20 instances for each aspect and check if GPT-4 predictions match their assessments given
the same instruction, demonstrations, and test instances. We found our assessments show high
agreement with GPT-4 predictions, especially for relevance (95%), retrieval necessity (95%), and
the degree of support (90%). Agreement was slightly lower in usefulness (80%), mostly due to the
disagreement between 1 and 2 or 4 and 5.

A.2 SELF-RAG TRAINING

Overview of training. Algorithm 2 provides a high-level overview of our training.

Full list of seed datasets. To sample diverse input-output pairs, we sample instances of the Open-
Instruct (Wang et al., 2023) dataset. In particular, we use their ShareGPT, GPT-4 Alpaca, Alpaca,
OpenAssistant, and FLAN subsets subsets. We also sample instances from a couple of knowledge-
intensive datasets, Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), Wizard of Wikipedia (Dinan et al.,
2019) and FEVER (Thorne et al., 2018) from the KILT benchmark (Petroni et al., 2021), ASQA (Stel-
makh et al., 2022) and multiple QA datasets including ARC-Easy and OpenBookQA (Mihaylov et al.,
2018). Table 3 shows the full list of training instances, and in total, we use 145,619 instances.

Performance of the Critic C. We evaluate the accuracy of reward predictions by splitting GPT-4
generated feedback into training, development, and test sets. The accuracy of the reward model is
as follows. Table 5 shows the model performance of predicting GPT-4 judgments. As you can see,
overall our fine-tuned reward model shows high prediction matching with GPT-4 predicted feedback.

Figure 5: Reward prediction accuracy using GPT-4 predictions as ground-truth predictions.

While our final model uses Llama2-7B as a base LM, we also train and compare FLAN-3B (Wei
et al., 2022) model on the same data, to investigate the effectiveness of different data sizes affect final
reward predictions. In most aspects, our reward model shows higher than 80% accuracy, indicating
the powerful ability of fine-tuned specialized LMs to evaluate text. While both models show relatively
lower performance on ISUSE , this is because both models often confuse between the two highest
cases (5 and 4), where human annotators can also disagree.

Details of M data creation. Here, we provide detailed data creation procedures. Algorithm 3
summarizes the process. Here we set yt to y for simplification. Once we train the critic model, we
first run it on input data from the aforementioned datasets, to predict whether retrieval is needed or
not. For the instances where the critic predicts Retrieve =No, we only predict the ISUSE given input
and output. For the instances where the critic predicts Retrieve =Yes, we first retrieve passages using
the input and the entire output as queries, to find passages that are relevant to the entire output. We
then split output sentences using Spacy.7 For each sentence, we run C to predict whether the retrieval
is necessary or not, given the input, preceding segments, and the initial retrieved passage. If C predicts
Retrieve =No, then do not insert any paragraph at the tth segment. If C predicts Retrieve =Yes, then

we use the original input and the tth segment as a retrieval query to find relevant passages for the
t-th segment. For each retrieved passage, we predict ISREL and ISSUP . If there is any passage and
continuation with ISREL =Relevant and ISSUP =Fully Supported / ISSUP =Partially

Supported, then we sample it as the continuation. If there is more than one passage satisfying this
criterion, we use the one with the highest retrieval score. If there are only ISREL =Irrelevant or

ISSUP =No Support passages, we randomly sample one passage.

Training examples. Table 4 show several training examples used for M training.

A.3 SELF-RAG INFERENCE

Details of beam-search score calculations. We first compute scores for each critique type by
taking the normalized probabilities of desirable tokens. For ISREL , we compute the score as follows:

p( ISREL = RELEVANT)
s( ISREL ) = .

p( ISREL = RELEVANT) + p( ISREL = IRRELEVANT)
For ISSUP , we compute the score as follows:

∑ p( ISSUP = FULLY)
.5× p( ISSUP = PARTIALLY)

s( ISREL ) = + 0 ,
S S

where S = t∈{FULLY,PARTIALLY,NO} p( ISSUP = t). For ISUSE where we have a five-scale score, we
compute the weighted sum of the scores. We assigns weighted scores of w = {−1,−0.5, 0, 0.5, 1}
to the tokens ISUSE ={1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and com∑pute the final scores as follows:

5
p( ISUSE = i)

∑ s( ISUSE ) = wi ,
S

i

where S = t∈{1,2,3,4,5} p( ISUSE = t).

Details of adaptive retrieval. For retrieval based on soft constraints, we trigger retrieval if the
following condition is satisfied:

p( Retrieve = YES)
> δ.

p( Retrieve = YES) + p(p( Retrieve = NO)

B EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

B.1 MORE DETAILS OF TRAINING

More details of training and computations. We use 4 Nvidia A100 with 80GB memory to train
our models. All models are trained for 3 epochs with a batch size of 128, a peak learning rate of 2e-5
with 3% warmup steps, and linear decay afterward. We set the maximum token length to be 2,048
for the 7B model, and 1,524 for the 13B model due to the memory constraint. We use Deepspeed
stage 3 (Rajbhandari et al., 2020) to conduct multi-GPU distributed training, with training precision
Bfloat16 enabled. FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) is used to make the long-context training more
efficient. We run inference of our trained models using 1-2 Quadro RTX 6000 GPUs with 24GB
memory.

B.2 MORE DETAILS OF EVALUATIONS

Retrieval setup details. By default, we use Contriever-MS MARCO to retrieve the top five
documents from Wikipedia, and use official Wikipedia embeddings based on 2018 English Wikipedia.
On PopQA, where question and answer pairs are created based on WikiData in 2022, we found
that the 2018 Wikipedia sometimes lacks articles about some entities that have been more recently
added to Wikipedia. Therefore, for PopQA, we used the December 2020 preprocessed Wikipedia
corpus provided by Izacard et al. (2022b) and generated document embeddings.8 The issues of
performance variance from different Wikipedia dumps have been reported by prior work (Asai et al.,
2020; Izacard et al., 2022b). Yet, we observe limited effectiveness of such off-the-shelf retrieval
models trained primarily on knowledge-intensive tasks for open-ended generation (e.g., instruction
following). Recent or concurrent work studies instruction-tuning of retrieval systems (Asai et al.,
2023b) or joint training of retrieval and LM components (Lin et al., 2023), while we leave exploring
the effectivess of such appraoches for future work. For bio generation and open-domain QA tasks,
we additionally retrieve five documents using Google Programmable Search9 and search documents
from English Wikipedia. As this API only provides snippets, we retrieve Wikipedia introductory
paragraphs for the corresponding entities.

Detailed experimental settings for individual datasets. For OpenQA datasets, we set the max-
imum new token number to 100 tokens. For closed-set tasks (PubHealth and ARC-C), we set the
maximum new token length to 50 for all baselines. For SELF-RAG inference on PubHealth and
ARC-C, instead of determining the output with the highest score 4 as in other tasks, we aggregate the
scores for each option and select the answer option with the highest score. We found in zero-shot
settings of fact checking, some LLMs can generate capitalized class labels (e.g., True) while our
gold labels are lower-cased. Therefore, across different LMs, for fact checking, we lowercase the
predictions. In multiple choice tasks, we found some models generate answers in slightly different
ways (e.g., (A) instead of A). We slightly modify instructions for each LLM to avoid such format
violations, and further conduct string matching between each candidate and model predictions if
format violations still remain. After that processing, in closed set tasks, model predictions match
one of the gold classes in almost all cases. For ALCE, we found that Llama2-chat tend to generate
significantly lower outputs than other models (e.g., on average, their output is nearly 100 token, while
ChatGPT generates 40 tokens on average), resulting in inflated str-em scores. We limit the maximum
generation length to 100 tokens for all baselines to avoid this issue, rather than the original 300
tokens in the ALCE paper. Consequently, all of the baseline output length is within 30-60 tokens.
For FactScore, we set the maximum new token length to 500 for baselines and 200 for SELF-RAG at
each segment level.

Task-specific instructions. Table 5 shows the list of the instructions used during evaluations. For
Open-domain QA, we do not provide explicit instructions.

C RESULTS

C.1 ANALYSIS

Reliance on parametric- and non-parametric memories. We conduct analysis on how frequently
model answers come from retrieved passages (non-parametric memories) or their own parametric
memories. On two open-domain QA datasets, TriviaQA and PopQA, we conduct the following
analysis: 1) sample query models successfully answer correctly, 2) for each query in this group,
check whether the matched ground-truth answer is a sub-string of the retrieved passage or not. We
evaluate SELF-RAG 7B, Alpaca 7B, Alpaca 13B, and Llama2-Chat-13B. We found that SELF-RAG
significantly less frequently generates answers that are not included in the provided evidence; in
particular, in Alpaca 30B, 20% of the correct predictions are not included in the provided passages,
followed by Llama2-chat 13B (18%) and Alpaca (15%), while it is only 2% in SELF-RAG. When
retrieved passages are not relevant, SELF-RAG generates ISREL =Irrelevant, indicating that the
following answers may not be factually grounded, while those instruction-tuned models continue to
generate plausible answers.

Input Identify the two types of computer memory. (from gpt4 alpaca)
Output [ Retrieve =Yes]<p>Computer memory Computer memory – In computing, memory refers to the
computer hardware integrated circuits that store information for immediate use in a computer; it is synonymous
with the term “primary storage”. Computer memory operates at a high speed, for example random-access memory
(RAM), as a distinction from storage that provides slow-to-access information but offers higher capacities. If
needed, contents of the computer memory can be transferred to secondary storage; a very common way of doing
this is through a memory management technique called “virtual memory”. An archaic synonym for memory is
store. The term “memory”, meaning “primary storage” or “main memory”, is<p>[ ISREL =Relevant]Primary
memory, also known as main memory, is the memory that the computer can directly access and manipulate.

semiconductor memory, i.e. integrated circuits consisting of silicon-based transistors, used for example as
primary storage but also other purposes in computers and other digital electronic devices. There are two main
kinds of semiconductor memory, volatile and non-volatile. Examples of non-volatile memory are flash memory
(used as secondary memory) and ROM, PROM, EPROM and EEPROM memory (used for storing firmware
such as BIOS). Examples of volatile memory are primary storage, which is typically dynamic random-access
memory (DRAM), and fast CPU cache memory, which is typically static random-access memory (SRAM)

bility or authority to another person (normally from a manager to a subordinate) to carry out specific activities. It
is one of the core concepts of management leadership. However, the person who delegated the work remains
accountable for the outcome of the delegated work. Delegation empowers a subordinate to make decisions, i.e. it
is a shifting of decision-making authority from one organizational level to a lower one. Delegation, if properly
done, is not fabrication. The opposite of effective delegation is micromanagement, where a manager provides too

Instructions
You will be provided with an instruction, evidence, output sentence, and preceding sentences
(optional). If the preceding sentence is given, the output should be the sentence that follows
those preceding sentences. Your task is to determine whether the information in the output
sentence can be fully verified by the evidence or if it requires further external verification.
There are three cases:
- If the output sentence can be verified solely with the evidence, then respond with [Continue
to Use Evidence].
- If the sentence doesn’t require any factual verification (e.g., a subjective sentence or a
sentence about common sense), then respond with [No Retrieval].
- If additional information is needed to verify the output sentence, respond with [Retrieval].
Please provide explanations for your judgments.

Instruction Explain the use of word embeddings in Natural Language Processing.
Preceding sentences Word embeddings are one of the most powerful tools available for
Natural Language Processing (NLP). They are mathematical representations of words or
phrases in a vector space, allowing similarities between words and the context in which they
are used to be measured.
Evidence: Word embedding
Word embedding is the collective name for a set of language modeling and feature learning
techniques in natural language processing (NLP) where words or phrases from the vocabulary
are mapped to vectors of real numbers. Conceptually it involves a mathematical embedding
from a space with one dimension per word to a continuous vector space with a much lower
dimension. Output: Word embeddings are useful for tasks such as sentiment analysis, text
classification, predicting the next word in a sequence, and understanding synonyms and
analogies.
Rating [Retrieval]
Explanation The output discusses the applications of word embeddings, while the evidence
only discusses the definitions of word embeddings and how they work. Therefore, we need to
retrieve other evidence to verify whether the output is correct or not.

Instructions
You’ll be provided with an instruction, along with evidence and possibly some preceding
sentences. When there are preceding sentences, your focus should be on the sentence that
comes after them. Your job is to determine if the evidence is relevant to the initial instruction
and the preceding context, and provides useful information to complete the task described in
the instruction. If the evidence meets this requirement, respond with [Relevant]; otherwise,
generate [Irrelevant].

Input Earth’s rotating causes
A: the cycling of AM and PM
B: the creation of volcanic eruptions
C: the cycling of the tides
D: the creation of gravity
Evidence Rotation causes the day-night cycle which also creates a corresponding cycle of

Explanation The evidence explicitly mentions that the rotation causes a day-night cycle, as
described in the answer option A.

Instruction age to run for US House of Representatives
Evidence The Constitution sets three qualifications for service in the U.S. Senate: age (at
least thirty years of age); U.S. citizenship (at least nine years); and residency in the state a
senator represents at the time of election.
Rating [Irrelevant]
Explanation The evidence only discusses the ages to run for the US Senate, not for the
House of Representatives.

Instructions
You will receive an instruction, evidence, and output, and optional preceding sentences. If the
preceding sentence is given, the output should be the sentence that follows those preceding
sentences. Your task is to evaluate if the output is fully supported by the information provided
in the evidence.
Use the following entailment scale to generate a score:
- [Fully supported] - All information in output is supported by the evidence, or extractions
from the evidence. This is only applicable when the output and part of the evidence are
almost identical.
- [Partially supported] - The output is supported by the evidence to some extent, but there
is major information in the output that is not discussed in the evidence. For example, if an
instruction asks about two concepts and the evidence only discusses either of them, it should
be considered a [Partially supported].
- [No support / Contradictory] - The output completely ignores evidence, is unrelated to the
evidence, or contradicts the evidence. This can also happen if the evidence is irrelevant to the
instruction.

Make sure to not use any external information/knowledge to judge whether the out-
put is true or not. Only check whether the output is supported by the evidence, and not
whether the output follows the instructions or not.

are mapped to vectors of real numbers. Conceptually it involves a mathematical embedding
from a space with one dimension per word to a continuous vector space with a much lower
dimension. Methods to generate this mapping include neural networks, dimensionality
reduction on the word co-occurrence matrix, probabilistic models, explainable knowledge
base method, and explicit representation in terms of the context in which words appear. Word
and phrase embeddings, when used as the underlying input representation, have been shown
to boost the performance in NLP tasks such as syntactic parsing, sentiment analysis, next
token predictions as well and analogy detection.

evidence mentions all of the applications syntactic parsing, sentiment analysis, next token
predictions as well as analogy detection as the applications. Therefore, the score should be

Instructions
Given an instruction and an output, rate whether the response appears to be a helpful and
informative answer to the query, from 1 (lowest) - 5 (highest). We call this score perceived
utility. The detailed criterion is as follows: 5: The response provides a complete, highly
detailed, and informative response to the query, fully satisfying the information needs. 4: The
response mostly fulfills the need in the query, while there can be some minor improvements
such as discussing more detailed information, having better structure of the response, or im-
proving coherence. 3: The response is acceptable, but some major additions or improvements
are needed to satisfy users’ needs. 2: The response still addresses the main request, but it is
not complete or not relevant to the query. 1: The response is barely on-topic or completely
irrelevant.

Output Boris Johnson was the prime minister of the UK from 2019 - 2022.
Perceived utility 2
Explanation While the output provides a factually correct statement about the UK prime
minister from 2019 to 2022, this instruction asks who the prime minister is as of 2023, so it
doesn’t answer the instruction. Therefore, the utility is 2.

Market, Harajuku, and Shinjuku Gyoen.
Perceived utility 3
Explanation This output doesn’t provide descriptions of each attraction and the number of
the attractions is also less than 10. While this output partially answers the instructions, it
doesn’t match the instructions strictly.
