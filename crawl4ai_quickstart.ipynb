This showcases Crawl4AI's flexibility in handling dynamic content and its ability to implement custom logic for even the most challenging crawling tasks."

        "The JsonCssExtractionStrategy is a powerful feature of Crawl4AI that allows for precise, structured data extraction from web pages. Here's how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. You define a schema that describes the pattern of data you're interested in extracting.\n",
        "2. The schema includes a base selector that identifies repeating elements on the page.\n",
        "3. Within the schema, you define fields, each with its own selector and type.\n",
        "4. These field selectors are applied within the context of each base selector element.\n",
        "5. The strategy supports nested structures, lists within lists, and various data types.\n",
        "6. You can even include computed fields for more complex data manipulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach allows for highly flexible and precise data extraction, transforming semi-structured web content into clean, structured JSON data. It's particularly useful for extracting consistent data patterns from pages like product listings, news articles, or search results.\n",
        "\n",
        "For more details and advanced usage, check out the full documentation on the Crawl4AI website."
